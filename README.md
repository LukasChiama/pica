Pica is a work-in-progress. It will be built with Node.js, React, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. Pica's GraphQL engine will be bootstrapped with Hasura. It will also take advantage of AWS S3 and Lambda functions. It might make use of serverless functions.

Pica aims to be a friendly help for sharing images, videos, and the stories you care about with those that matter most to you.
