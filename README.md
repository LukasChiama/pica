#### Pica
Pica is still very much in development. It is designed to be a modern day framework that allows users share the stories closest to their hearts with those that matter most to them.

It is being developed with very modern technologies: GraphQL, TypeScript, and React. Pica used hasura to bootstrap a GraphQL engine that runs on a PostgreSQL database and is set up on Docker.

Pica aims to be a friendly help for sharing images, videos, and the stories you care about with those that matter most to you.

Pica is offered on an MIT license and heartily welcomes contributions and PRs.
